{"name":"Stackduino 2","tagline":"","body":"Stackduino-2\r\n============\r\nThis is the new version of Stackduino (reallysmall.github.io/Stackduino/). \r\nStackduino is an open source motion controller, designed primarily for focus stacking, which interfaces with a stepper motor, limit switches and a camera shutter.\r\n \r\nKey development targets for Stackduino 2 are:\r\n \r\n1/ A smaller footprint\r\n2/ More efficient use of battery power\r\n3/ Provision for future expansion of functionality\r\n \r\nPower\r\n \r\nAutomatic switchover between ac adapter and batteries is supported by an LTC4412 and Mosfet at a much lower forward voltage drop than using diode ORing for greater efficiency of battery use.\r\n \r\nStep-down to 5v is handled with a LM2675 buck converter for considerable efficiency improvement over the standard linear regulator used in Stackduino 1.\r\n \r\nPower on/ off is supported by the LTC2950 pushbutton controller. This also interfaces with the micro-controller to allow the system to switch itself off.\r\n \r\nCore functions\r\n \r\nMCP23017 port expander allows software control over most stepper driver functions, power monitoring and system switch-off.\r\nFT232RL interfaces microcontroller with onboard usb port for simple reprogramming.\r\n16x2 parallel lcd replaced with 128x64 OLED, which is more feature rich, smaller, uses less pins and less power.\r\n \r\nI/O\r\n \r\nStackduino 1's DB9 port replaced with a DB15 port, supporting signals for:\r\n \r\nGround (3)\r\nStepper motor (4)\r\nLimit switches (2)\r\nFocus and shutter (2)\r\nDigital pin (2 - currently unused, to support future functionality)\r\nAnalogue pin (2 - currently unused, to support future functionality)\r\n","google":"UA-45814549-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
